        We kicked off the project with a focused discovery sprint to align on
        user needs, business goals, and product constraints. Through stakeholder
        interviews, competitor reviews, and quick user surveys, we identified
        key pain points in the current experience. This early work gave us
        clarity on what to prioritize and helped shape a product direction
        grounded in real customer behavior.
